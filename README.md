# kubernetes_demo
Kubernetes and Docker files for the demos of [Kubernetes for the absolute beginners](https://www.udemy.com/learn-kubernetes/) and [Docker for the absolute beginners](https://www.udemy.com/learn-docker/) courses. I don't know if you're still reading since it sounds super boring, but believe me it helps a lot to have these in a separate repo to get them all from GCloud console in one go.
